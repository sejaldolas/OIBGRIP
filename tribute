                “Freedom of mind is the real freedom.
                A person whose mind is not free though he may not be in chains, is a slave, not a free man.
                One whose mind is not free, though he may not be in prison, is a prisoner and not a free man.
                One whose mind is not free though alive, is no better than dead.

                <span>Freedom of mind is the proof of one's existence.”</span>

                <strong>Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar</strong> a fighter in the cause of Annihilation of Caste, was born in a
                low-caste Mahar family on 14th April, 1891, at Mhow cantonment,
                where his father served in the Army. Dr B R Ambedkar was born in a caste which was considered as the
                lowest of the low.
                <br><br>
                Born of a Dalit Mahar family of western India, he was as a boy humiliated by his high-caste
                schoolfellows.
                His father was an officer in the Indian army. Awarded a scholarship by the Gaekwar (ruler) of Baroda
                (now Vadodara),
                he studied at universities in the United States, Britain, and Germany. He entered the Baroda Public
                Service at the Gaekwar’s request,
                but, again ill-treated by his high-caste colleagues, he turned to legal practice and to teaching. He
                soon established his leadership among Dalits, founded several journals on their behalf,
                and succeeded in obtaining special representation for them in the legislative councils of the
                government.
                <br><br>
                Contesting Mahatma Gandhi’s claim to speak for Dalits (or Harijans, as Gandhi called them),
                he wrote What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (1945).
                In 1947 Ambedkar became the law minister of the government of India. He took a leading part in the
                framing of the Indian constitution, outlawing discrimination against untouchables, and skillfully helped
                to steer it through the assembly.
                He resigned in 1951, disappointed at his lack of influence in the government. In October 1956, in
                despair because of the perpetuation of untouchability in Hindu doctrine,
                he renounced Hinduism and became a Buddhist, together with about 200,000 fellow Dalits, at a ceremony in
                Nagpur. Ambedkar’s book The Buddha and His Dhamma appeared posthumously in 1957,
                and it was republished as The Buddha and His Dhamma: A Critical Edition in 2011, edited, introduced, and
                annotated by Aakash Singh Rathore and Ajay Verma.
